# icalendar-rrule
This is an add-on to the [iCalendar Gem](https://github.com/icalendar/icalendar).
It helps to handle calendars in iCalendar format with __repeating events__.

According to the [RFC 5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) specification, 
repeating events are represented by one single entry, the repetitions being shown by
an attached _repeat rule_. Thus when we iterate through a calendar with, for example,
a daily repeating event, 
we'll only see one single entry in the Calendar.
Although, for a whole month there would be 30 or 31 events in reality.

The _icalendar-rrule gem_ patches an additional function called `scan` into the _iCalendar Gem_. 
The _scan_ shows all events by unrolling the _repeat rule_ for a 
given time period.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'icalendar-rrule'
```

and run `bundle install` from your shell.

## Usage

For explanations on how to parse and process RFC 5545 compatible calendars, please
have a look at the [iCalendar gem](http://github.com/icalendar/icalendar).

To use this gem we'll first have to require it: 

`require 'icalendar-rrule'`

Further we have to declare the use of the "Scannable" namespace. 
This is called a "[Refinement](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/doc/syntax/refinements_rdoc.html)",
a _new Ruby core feature_ since Ruby 2.0, that makes "monkey patching" a bit 
more acceptable.

`using Icalendar::Scannable`

Now we can inquire a calendar for all events (or tasks) within in a time span. 

`scan = calendar.scan(begin_time, closing_time)`

Here is a simple example:
```ruby
require 'icalendar-rrule' # this will require all needed GEMS including the icalendar gem

using Icalendar::Scannable # this will make the function Icalendar::Calendar.scan available

# we create a calendar with one single event
calendar = Icalendar::Calendar.new
calendar.event do |e|
  # the event starts on January first and lasts from half past eight to five o' clock
  e.dtstart     =  DateTime.civil(2018, 1, 1, 8, 30)
  e.dtend       =  DateTime.civil(2018, 1, 1, 17, 00)
  e.summary     = 'Working'
  # the event repeats all working days
  e.rrule       = 'FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR'
end

begin_time =   Date.new(2018, 4, 22)
closing_time = Date.new(2018, 4, 29)

# we are interested in the calendar entries in the last week of April
scan = calendar.scan(begin_time, closing_time) # that's where the magic happens


scan.each do |occurrence|
  puts "#{occurrence.start_time.strftime('%a. %b. %d. %k:%M')}-#{occurrence.end_time.strftime('%k:%M')}"
end
```
This will produce:

```
Mon. Apr. 23.  8:30-17:00 
Tue. Apr. 24.  8:30-17:00 
Wed. Apr. 25.  8:30-17:00 
Thu. Apr. 26.  8:30-17:00 
Fri. Apr. 27.  8:30-17:00 
```
